Credit Risk Analysis Report

Analysis Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of a logistic regression model in predicting 
the credit risk of loans. By analyzing the loan data, we aim to determine the likelihood of loans 
being either healthy or high risk. This analysis helps financial institutions make informed decisions about 
approving or denying loans based on the risk associated with each loan.

Results:
Accuracy Score: The Model achieved an accuracy score of 99%.
Precision Score (Class 0- Healthy Loan): The precision score for predicting healthy loans it 100%
Recall Score (Class 0- Healthy Loan): The recall score for predicting healthy loans is 100%.
Precision Score (Class 1- High Risk Loan): The precision score for predicting high risk loans is 86%.
Recall Score (Class 1- High Risk Loan): The recall score for predicting high risk loans is 91%.

Summary:
The logistic regression model demonstrates a strong ability to predict healthy loans (Class 0) with perfect 
precision and recall scores, indicating that the model is highly accurate in identifying loans that are unlikely 
to default. For high risk loans (Class 1), the model achieves a reasonable precision of 86% and recall of 91%. 
This means that 86% of loans predicted as high-risk are actually high-risk, and the model identifies 91% of actual 
high-risk loans, with a few false positives and false negatives.

Based on these results, I recommend using this logistic regression model for credit risk assessment. The high 
accuracy and performance in predicting healthy loans provide confidence in the model's ability to identify low risk 
loans. While there is room for improvement in predicting high risk loans, the model still offers valuable insights 
that can assist in making informed lending decisions.
